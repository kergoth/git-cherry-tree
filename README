git-cherry-tree
===============

Find commits not merged in the destination branch.

Same as `git-cherry`, but consider only patches touching given subdirs, and try
hard to check if the patch was actually applied.  Has also extra features for
interactive picking of a patch sequence.

Examples:

  Which patches are in current branch, but not in 0.8.x
  $ git cherry-tree 0.8.x

  Which patches are in master branch, in directory `spam`, but not in 0.8.x
  $ git cherry-tree 0.8.x master -- spam

  Interactively cherry-pick missing patches in `spam` directory
  $ git cherry-tree -pix 0.8.x master -- spam
